## Abstract
Harmful algal blooms (HABs) are episodes of high concentrations of algae that are potentially toxic for human consumption. Mollusc farming can be affected by HABs because, as filter feeders, they can accumulate high concentrations of marine biotoxins in their tissues. To avoid the risk to human consumption, harvesting is prohibited when toxicity is detected. At present, the closure of the production areas is based on expert knowledge and lacks predictive models to support it. This work aims to create a predictive model capable of supporting decision making on days when it is not possible to carry out a previous sampling. Although the concentration of toxin in meat is the method most commonly used by experts in the control of shellfish production areas, it is rarely used as a target by automatic prediction models. This is largely due to the irregularity of the data due to the established sampling programs. As an alternative, the activity status of production areas has been proposed as a target variable based on whether mollusc meat has a toxicity level below or above the legal limit. This new option is the most similar to the actual functioning of the control of shellfish production areas. For this purpose, we have made a comparison between hybrid machine learning models like Neural-Network-Adding Bootstrap (BAGNET) and Discriminative Nearest Neighbor Classification (SVM-KNN) when estimating the state of production areas. The study has been carried out in several estuaries with different levels of complexity in the episodes of algal blooms to demonstrate the generalization capacity of the models in bloom detection. As a result, we could observe that, with an average recall value of 93.41\% and without dropping below 90\% in any of the estuaries, BAGNET outperforms the other models both in terms of results and robustness.

## Highlights

*	Presence of toxicity in molluscan shellfish meat as a target for predicting HABs
*	Hybrid AI methods outperform classical methods in predicting HABs
*	Analysing the behaviour of hybrid machine learning models against unbalanced datasets
*	BAGNET offers the best results in the prediction of HABs in complex regions
